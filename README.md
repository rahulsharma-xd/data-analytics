# ðŸš— Road Accident Analysis

This project was developed as part of my learning journey during a two-month Data Analytics course. The objective is to analyze a road accident dataset to uncover insights, identify patterns, and support better decision-making for improving road safety.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Analyze the frequency and severity of road accidents.
- Identify high-risk locations and time periods.
- Explore the influence of weather, road, and light conditions on accident severity.
- Apply core data analytics skills including data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and interpretation.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data handling and manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and analysis
- **Git & GitHub** for version control and project sharing

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Peak accident times were observed during rush hours.
- Adverse weather and poor lighting conditions significantly increased accident severity.
- Specific road types and intersections showed higher accident concentrations.
- Latitude and longitude analysis helped visualize accident hotspots.
